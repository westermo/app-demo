DHCP-Boot application, download WeOS configuration from application
===================================================================

Introduction
-------------

The `dhcp-boot` application is an example of how a container application could
create or alter a configuration file. In a real world scenario a non native configuration file
could be converted to WeOS native format.
In this simple example the application only changes the hostname to verify that the 
configuration has been received from the application. The host will download
the file from the application using TFTP and use it as a new running config:

```
Host            #  Dhcp-boot Application
                #  .-------------.  .-------------.
                #  | DHCP-server |  | TFTP-server |
                #  '------+------'  '------+------'
.------------.  #         '------.  .------'
|    cfg     |  #              .-+--+-.
| inet: dhcp |  #              | eth0 |
'------+-----'  #              '--+---'
       |        #                 |
       '--------------------------'
```


A configuration file is changed by the application via the script create-config.sh.
In this simple example only the hostname is changed.
The container application will be connected to the host via a VETH pair, cfg/eth0.
The application provide a configuration file for dnsmasq and starts it.
Dnsmasq will serve as both DHCP server and TFTP server in the container.
The host downloads the converted configuration file using TFTP and use it as
a new running-config.

The application side of the VETH pair (eth0) is configured via /etc/network/interfaces.
The IP address is set to 10.0.0.1/30 and has to be consistent with option 66 in dnsmasq.conf.

This is the dnsmasq.conf provided by the container application:
**dnsmasq.conf**
```
log-facility=-
no-daemon

enable-tftp
tftp-root=/tmp

interface=eth0
dhcp-option=66,"10.0.0.1"
dhcp-option=67,"config.cfg"

dhcp-range=tag:eth0,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.2,1h
```

Configuration
-------------

### Prepare External Media (USB in this case)

It is important that the USB media is formatted as ext2, ext3 or ext4. We also
need to create two files on the external media:

- `pre-config.cfg`: The config file that the application alter (and save as config.cfg).
- `config/net-config.cfg`: The bootstrap config that will carry the
  configuration for our application container.

### pre-config.cfg
Configuration file containing a hostname.
E.g.
{
  .
  .
  "system": {
    "hostname": "Host",
    .
    .
    .
  },
  .
  .
}

### config.cfg
In our example `config.cfg` is generated by the application by
altering the hostname in the pre-config.cfg.

The file should look something like this after the conversion.

```
{
  .
  .
  "system": {
    "hostname": "Host_name_from_app",
    .
    .
    .
  },
  .
  .
}
```

After reboot the container application starts up, the host fetches the new
running-config from the container, and that config is applied, resulting in
the `hostname` changing to "Host_name_from_app".

Prepare the external media by creating the net-config.cfg file:
### creation of config/net-config.cfg
net-config will be stored on external media.

Configure the app that will host/run the files we have created:

<pre class="cli-example">
example:/#> configure app cfg dhcp-boot
example:/config/app-cfg/#> share path /usb as /mnt
example:/config/app-cfg/#> end
</pre>

Along with the app, a VETH pair is created. By default it will have the same name as the
app on the host side, and `eth0` on the container side. 
We need to configure DHCP for the host side interface:

<pre class="cli-example">
example:/#> configure iface cfg
example:/config/iface-cfg/#> inet dhcp
example:/config/iface-cfg/inet-dhcp/#> option 66, 67
example:/config/iface-cfg/inet-dhcp/#> leave
</pre>

The net-config is now complete. Copy it to the external media and reset the
running-config:

<pre class="cli-example">
example:/#> copy running-config usb://config/net-config.cfg
Copying running-config to /usb/config/net-config.cfg ...
example:/#> Done.
Host:/#> copy factory-config running-config
Applying configuration.
</pre>

### Creation of pre-config.cfg
pre-config will be stored on USB media. Simply set the hostname to Host.

<pre class="cli-example">
example:/#> configure system
example:/config/system/#> hostname Host
example:/config/system/#> leave
Applying configuration.
Configuration activated.  Remember "copy run start" to save to flash (NVRAM).
Host:/#> cp running-config usb://pre-config.cfg
Copying running-config to /usb/pre-config.cfg ...
Done.
</pre>

Finally we configure our system to use net-config on external media to boot
the system, and reboot:
	
<pre class="cli-example">
example:/#> boot
example:/boot/#> config-order ext:net
example:/boot/#> leave
example:/#> reboot
</pre>

After reboot the container application starts and changed the hostname to
"Host_name_from_app" and saves the new configuration in /tmp/config.cfg. The host fetches
and applies the new running-config from the container, resulting in the `hostname` being changed.
